## Proper Motion analysis of HH212 and HH46/47

This repository contains the code and resulting report of the proper motion analysis of two protostellar jets. We use the JWST and Hubble telescope data and compare those images to calculate proper motion characteristics like speed, acceleration and dynamic age of the protostellar jets.
